# Work-Day-Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler calendar allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This application allows the user to input notes into the specific time blocks. The inputed notes will be saved and each timeblock will turn into a different color based on the current time because it is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. This calendar is a great way to stay organized and to manage time efficiently.

## Process

In this homework, we had to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. I pseudo coded the process on how to build the function of the calendar and the layout which helped out greatly.

I never thought I would be so happy to see random characters/numbers generated. It was extremely satisfying to see the password generated below:
